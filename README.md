Homework assignment to create a responsive portfolio

# H1 General

This is a first pass at a responsive portfolio based on specifications outlined in the assignment README. A few requirements:

    * A navbar that must be consistent on each page.

    * A responsive layout with responsive images

    * Each page must have valid and correct semantic HTML. (use a validation service)

    * The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

    * On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

# H1 Nav Bar

Consistent across all pages with functional links. The links within the Portfolio dropdown all link to the Portfolio page, as the projects are not live yet.

Name on left side links to my GitHub profile.

# H1 About Me

The "home" page containing my personalized information, including bio, name, images, links to social media, and what I'm currently studying.

Text wraps around headshot if enough content is there to be required.

Currently Learning images enlarge on hover.

All links work.

# H1 Portfolio

I used a Card Deck from bootstrap to ensure proper spacing and responsiveness. Once the projects are live, the thumbnails will link to the appropriate pages.

# H1 Brewing

Very similar to the Portfolio page, each thumbnail will link to a page describing the ingredients, recipe, and brewing process followed.

Homework assignment to create a responsive portfolio

# H1 General
This is a first pass at a responsive portfolio based on specifications outlined in the assignment README. A few requirements:

    * A navbar that must be consistent on each page.

    * A responsive layout with responsive images

    * Each page must have valid and correct semantic HTML. (use a validation service)

    * The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

    * On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.
